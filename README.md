# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Internship Task
This project is completed as **Task 1** of the **Data Science Internship at Interncred**.

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and travel-related features.

## Dataset
Titanic dataset from Kaggle (`train.csv`).

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train-test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The model achieved approximately **78% accuracy** on test data.
Key factors influencing survival included gender, passenger class, age, and family size.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from raw data analysis to model evaluation, using real-world data.
